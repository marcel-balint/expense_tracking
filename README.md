In this project I used basic React.js features as follows:

- **React state and events:**

  - Passing data via props;
  - Listening to events and working with event handlers;
  - Working with `useState` hook (using multiple states);
  - Listening to user input;
  - Two-way data binding;
  - Handling form submission;
  - Passing data from _child_ to _parent_ components (botto-op)

- **Rendering lists and conditional content**

  - Working with lists (rendering lists of data);
  - Outputting conditional content;
  - Adding conditional return statements;
  - Adding dynamic styles;
